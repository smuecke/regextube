2. Select all files within `regextube` and compress them to a .zip file `RegexTube.zip`
3. Select `RegexTube.zip`, press `F2` and change the file name to `RegexTube.xpi`
4. In Firefox, open the Addons menu (e.g. by typing `about:addons` in your URL bar)
5. Click on the gear symbol near the top and select *install addon from file*, then choose `RegexTube.xpi`
6. Confirm that you want to add the addon
